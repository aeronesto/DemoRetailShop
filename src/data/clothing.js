    Maldonado's concept for L'Agence was simple: washed silks and Japanese
    and Italian fabrics. A firm believer in elements of enduring style—fabric
    and its hand, combined with great fit—L'AGENCE sets out to create styles
    that remain in a woman's wardrobe year after year. Each season is meant to
    complement the next. \n\n L'Agence's 'Jane' camisole looks chic on its own,
    but will work equally well with blazers or jackets in cooler temperatures.
    Cut from silk-crepe in a slightly loose silhouette, this tiger-print piece
    has an elegant V-neckline and adjustable straps so you can find your
    perfect fit.`,
